# esp8266-mqtt
Simple MQTT client and broker using ESP8266

This repository store my simple MQTT project for both broker and client to run in ESP8266 plaforms.
The original work is from [esp_mqtt](https://github.com/martin-ger/esp_mqtt) and this work is just trying to simplify the examples.
To compile this sources tree, you need a Linux machine with [esp-open-sdk](https://github.com/pfalcon/esp-open-sdk) and [esptool](https://github.com/espressif/esptool) installed.
