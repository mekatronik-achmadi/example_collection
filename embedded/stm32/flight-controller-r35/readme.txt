** ChibiOS/RT HAL - UART driver demo for STM32.                            **
*****************************************************************************

** TARGET **

The demo runs on an LC Studio STM32-P103 board.

** Goal **

Test the I2C devices, and print the aquired data to UART.

** Build Procedure **

The demo has been tested using the free Codesourcery GCC-based toolchain
and YAGARTO.
Just modify the TRGT line in the makefile in order to use different GCC ports.

** Notes **

First get UART to work
Get Ext to work for user interaction
Get I2C data
